If the Texas sun had a fragrance, it would smell like the small, speckled tortillas that cradle confit brisket tacos with “black magic oil” (made from sesame and smoked Morita chiles) and come alongside grilled fish with bacon salsa or a whopping goat shoulder cooked barbacoa-style. Nuñez alchemizes the dough into half a dozen other magnetic variations, including tlacoyos (plush dough pockets) filled with pork belly carnitas, and incredibly thin blue-corn tostadas to add crunch to gorgeous red prawn aguachile.
