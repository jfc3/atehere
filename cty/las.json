Our goal is to see your smile. The owner-chef, Mitsuo Endo, was born in Tokyo in 1971. He became an apprentice chef in 1988 and learned Kaiseki: Japanese traditional course style cuisine, at prestigious kaiseki restaurants in Tokyo. When he was thirty, he decided to move to the United States to make his dream come true. The first restaurant he opened as a head chef was in Seattle in 2001. Next year, he put himself in the more challenging city, New York. In 2002, Endo met his mentor Koji Imai who taught him the quintessence of food, and he joined for opening MEGU Tribeca and Midtown as an executive chef. In 2007, he moved to Las Vegas to seek new challenges and opened EN as a head chef. In 2008, he opened his own restaurant, &ldqou;Aburiya Raku&rdqou;.'",
