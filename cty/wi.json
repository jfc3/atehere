				"note": "The Brick House Cafe is located in downtown Cable, Wisconsin in the heart of the Chequamegon National Forest. The Brick House Cafe offers great coffee, espresso, lattes, mochas, frappes, smoothies, pastries, and desserts as well as Breakfast and Lunch. Established in 2005, they offer unique, fresh, creative menu items, pastries baked fresh daily, homemade soups and desserts, and outstanding service and hospitality. People should order the espresso BBQ pulled pork sandwich which is prepared with a homemade dry rub and then marinated; the pork is topped with a delicious barbecue sauce that gives it a smoky flavor. Another favorite is the French toast with a caramel-toffee Brulee drizzle.",
