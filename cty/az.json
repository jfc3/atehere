As a boy, he ate, slept, and breathed baseball (he was nearly a champion at 12), now he puts that same drive into Sonoran food. He owns and operates three El Guero Canelo restaurants, a meat market in Tucson, a bakery and tortilla factory in Magdalena (he had to be sure the quality was just right).' Titus tweeted 'Sonoran Dog from El Güero Canelo (Tucson, AZ). Bacon-wrapped frank, pinto beans, grilled and raw onion, tomato, mayo, mustard, jalapeno sauce on a local bolillo roll. Originally a street-side stand, it won a James Beard &ldquo;American Classic&rdquo; award a few years back. Since 1993.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
