You should or order the fish in banana leaf, or the Cochinita Pibil which is pork is marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted overnight, topped with pickled red onion and Yucatán-style pico de gallo for a meal or tacos. Don't forget to order the Tilapia wrapped in banana leaves or the smoked goat. From the Phonix Eater website, ‘The Mexican food scene in metro Phoenix can be divided into two eras: before Barrio Cafe’s opening in 2002 — and after. Classically trained chef Silvana Salcido Esparza broke the mold, serving pre-dinner bread instead of the usual chips and salsa while lightly applying French cooking techniques to preparations from all over Mexico — cochinita pibil from the Yucatan, nut-studded chiles en nogada from Puebla, fish from Veracruz, and silky moles from Oaxaca. The work of local Mexican artists fill the restaurant’s interior walls, while the exterior swirls with colorful murals. Agave-based spirits are everywhere these days, but Barrio was the first restaurant in the area to offer a vast selection of them.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

Relationships with the farmers, the local producers, his family, customers, and staff; and the respect and sincere intentions he approaches his recipes with, as well as the many interpersonal relationships that have influenced his philosophy and who he is. Chef Nancy Silverton, who founded La Brea Bakery and was a co-founder of Pizzeria Mozza, stated in her book The Mozza Cookbook, “If there was any pizza that I did aspire to, it was a pie made by Chris Bianco, whose Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, AZ is a mecca for the pizza obsessed. When I took a bite of Chris’ pizza, I was speechless. Eating it turned out to be a life-altering experience.”’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
