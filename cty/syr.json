				"note": "Dinosaur Bar-B-Que started here is Syracuse and is now a barbecue chain serving Southern-style meats and draft brews in a retro setting (most have live music). From their website, ‘Dinosaur Bar-B-Que opened its Syracuse restaurant doors in 1988, selling only BBQ before opening the full bar in 1991. The restaurant was reconfigured a few times, including adding two private party rooms upstairs in what was formerly Andy’s Cycle Shop. The Dinosaur Bar-B-Que began life in 1983 as a mobile concession stand using a 55-gallon drum cut in half. The idea was hatched by founder John Stage and his two partners at the Harley Rendezvous, a massive motorcycle gathering near Albany, N.Y. The three partners believed that bikers deserve a good plate of food and that the Dinosaur could provide it.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
