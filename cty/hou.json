				"note": "Blood Bros. BBQ is a casual joint serving classic Texas barbecue plus sides and occasional Asian and Louisiana fusion dishes. From their website, 'If you look closely, you’ll see (and taste and smell) the story of Houston barbecue. The bark on the brisket isn’t just salt and pepper but includes spices that Hoang grew up with in Chinatown. The pork ribs — a canonical dish of the African-American tradition of Houston barbecue — are meaty and fragrant with a spicy/sweet rub. And the soon-to-be-on-the-menu green curry boudin is a throwback to the long Creole tradition in the Bayou City. Far from being a static cuisine, Houston barbecue continues to change and evolve.' From the Houston Eater website, 'Founded by three Alief natives, this Bellaire smokehouse is where Asian flavors and Texas barbecue techniques collide. Try favorites like the pork ribs, togarashi smoked chicken, and gouda mac and cheese in-house. Alternatively, place a bulk order of pork belly burnt ends, jalapeno-cheddar sausage, brisket fried rice, and ambrosia salad. Advance orders require a minimum of five pounds of meat, and must be placed 48 hours in advance via Blood Bros’s website.'",

				"note": "Burns Original BBQ is a longtime family business known for smoked ribs, brisket, housemade sausage, and other BBQ favorites. From their websie, 'It all started in 1973 when Roy Burns Sr. started off his small local business venture selling barbecue to the acres home community in Houston, Texas. By creating his signature barbecue rub and sauce, he began leaving customers satisfied, causing the lines to grow longer and his business to boom. Now more than 40 years later, Burns Original BBQ has steadily grown its customer base and is still creating great food out of the original and still standing building that Roy Burns Sr. started it all in, and the delicious scent of barbecue from our woodsmoke pits still drift in the streets, and passers-by can't help themselves.'",
