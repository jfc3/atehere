The food may careen into French territory here and there, but this is really exuberant, zigzagging American cooking. Just have it: oeufs en mayonnaise, scented with smoked maple, bacon, and roasted garlic and beaded with trout roe; sliders dubbed “steam burgers,” the beef patty revved with French onion soup; and the already-famous duck stack, a mound of pancakes pummeled with duck gravy, Tabasco onions, a runny duck egg, and, to add excess to overindulgence, optional seared foie gras on top. This all tastes way more of restrained balance than seems possible. Downing a last few drops of Champagne, I bounced out the door humming with a single thought: That was fun.' According to J.

By creating meaningful relationships with our partners, importers, and coworkers, we curate the highest quality experience for our customers. At our core, our mission is simple: to share great coffee. We recognize that coffee is a seasonal fruit and that beans from different regions and climates should be treated differently. Finding an optimal roast profile for a given bean is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, but we believe that the only way to fully respect the intrinsic qualities of that bean is to tailor our roast to each lot. In so doing, we believe we are also respecting the hard work and attention to detail of those preceding us in the production chain. At Roseline Coffee, we will always source the highest quality and freshest ingredients.'",
