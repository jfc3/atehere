Just have it: oeufs en mayonnaise, scented with smoked maple, bacon, and roasted garlic and beaded with trout roe; sliders dubbed “steam burgers,” the beef patty revved with French onion soup; and the already-famous duck stack, a mound of pancakes pummeled with duck gravy, Tabasco onions, a runny duck egg, and, to add excess to overindulgence, optional seared foie gras on top.

A recent dinner started with hamachi in a creamy dressing, adorned with the most delightful cantaloupe popping boba, shaved late summer melon, adding crunch akin to celery. Nectarines pickled with aji amarillo and purple sorrel invigorate a braised goat sope, while a panko-breaded veal sausage paired with halibut appears at the center of a shallow pool of sauerkraut broth, sweetened with kernels of corn and evoking the Oregon Coast. And, while Le Pigeon’s tasting menus have always shape-shifted over the years, the finale — a foie gras profiterole — remains a testament to Rucker’s cheeky culinary style.

Podnah’s Pit has been blessing Portlanders with Texas and Carolina-style meats for 14 years, offering an unpretentious, minimalist space for diners to dig into 12-hour-smoked pulled pork and 10-hour-smoked brisket with a skinny slice of cornbread. Podnah’s cornbread is skillet-cooked, savory with plenty of grease from the fry, and browned near the edges—primed and eager to please the “cornbread, not cake” purists.’",
