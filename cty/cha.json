Clumpies Ice Cream Co. has been handcrafting the best ice cream in Chattanooga since 1999. Opened by the son of a third-generation candy maker, Clumpies has sought to create a product as amazing and one-of-a-kind as the city where it started. The business changed hands in 2013, but our mission is still the same: Serve every person that walks through our doors incredible ice cream and create unforgettable memories worth repeating. Each batch of Clumpies ice cream is made by hand with only the finest ingredients that can be found. From our ice cream mix that we pasteurize ourselves from fresh milk and cream to our house-made cookies, cakes, chunks, jams, and sauces that we swirl into our ice cream, we always strive to make the best ice cream around. We churn our ice cream in small batches, ten gallons or less at a time.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

Goodman Coffee recognizes the only way for a holistic vision to succeed is by honoring every piece of the story. This means celebrating the centuries-old history of land and farmers by partnering directly with producers, ensuring every square hectare of land and pair of hands holds inherent value in the movement from farm to consumer. It means we develop relationships that transcend profit margins and strive to protect those origins by roasting, brewing, and serving our coffee with integrity.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

The fish served is big, so big you can break one piece in half so it can fit the bread. Uncle Larry’s also has homemade desserts. We offer cheesecakes (cherry, strawberry, Butterfinger); blisses (peanut butter with Reese’s and Oreo Cookie); cakes (Key Lime, Red Velvet, Carrot, 7Up, and Italian Cream); and Banana Pudding.’ Titus tweeted ‘Variety Plate (catfish, whiting, perch) at Uncle Larry’s Hot Fish.
