From their website, ‘Born on historic Magazine Street, where food is life, the chef-inspired menu at Mahony’s is loaded with fresh Louisiana seafood and local classics that deliver an authentic taste of New Orleans in every bite. Made only from the freshest ingredients, our mouthwatering po-boys and seafood will make you wish you had room for more. A Po-boy (or po’ boy, po boy, or poor boy) is a traditional sandwich born in Louisiana and served on submarine-style French bread stuffed with meat or seafood (or sometimes both!). Since its origins in the 1800s, the Po-boy has been one of New Orleans’ favorite bites to eat. Despite their popularity, many of the city’s famous Po-boy shops have begun to disappear. Mahony’s Po-Boys and Seafood is a tribute to those classic neighborhood Po-boy shops of New Orleans. Mahony’s combines fresh local ingredients and family recipes to re-create the standard Po-boy classics and also offer new, creative and exciting versions of New Orleans’ favorite sandwich.’",

The pulled pork shoulder taco is moist, smoky, and irresistible, as is one with battered and fried fish that will have you thinking you're in San Diego, which happens to be where Schnoebelen grew up. There's a small clearing with assorted lawn furniture to sit at farther down the alley, which is decorated with voodoo-themed drawings and paintings.
