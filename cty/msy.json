Carmo’s raw seafood menu features the region’s freshest fish prepared in a variety of styles, including shima sashimi (raw, flash-cured fish, a style common to Japan’s tropical islands), tiradito (a Peruvian version of sashimi, smothered in aji amarillo pepper sauce) and rum-cured, cold-smoked yellowfin tuna. There’s also a raw vegan menu which introduces diners to shio-koji style preparation, avocados, organic tofu, and other fresh vegetables lightly fermented using a koji (aspergillus oryzae) marinade, which almost magically imparts distinct umami characteristics to any food to which it is exposed. The beverage menu is equally as unique, featuring exotic fruit such as juice of the cocoa fruit (cacau), açerola, cupuaçu, graviola (sour sop), caja and caju, which infuse Carmo's juice and cocktail menu with exciting new flavors.'",

Luckily it was a happy ending for all: a much-better-rested Schnoebelen and Casebonne opened a hole in the fence that separates their house from an alley housing a working voodoo temple, installed a counter, and started selling some of the city's best tacos on weekend days and Tuesday nights. The pulled pork shoulder taco is moist, smoky, and irresistible, as is one with battered and fried fish that will have you thinking you're in San Diego, which happens to be where Schnoebelen grew up. There's a small clearing with assorted lawn furniture to sit at farther down the alley, which is decorated with voodoo-themed drawings and paintings. Its name is Rosalie Alley, and it's located between two streets named Piety and Desire—which of course, is where most of us dwell nearly all the time.'",
