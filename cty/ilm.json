The food will be creative, seasonal, fresh, and uniquely Wilmington.’ From the Carolina Eater website, ‘After taking flight in spring 2021, Seabird has quickly soared to the top of Wilmington’s restaurant scene.

A nautically inspired interior is the setting for Neff’s creative menu that is heavy on seafood, like the swordfish schnitzel, a seasonal seafood tower, and a smoked catfish and oyster pie. The cozy bar transforms into a counter-service coffee, breakfast, and lunch scene each morning with sandwiches, soups, pastries, and more.’ You can customize your display and select which columns you would like to see.
