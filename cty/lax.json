For years, they’ve been planning a second place to present both the foods of their heritage (Menashe grew up in Israel, with Turkish and Moroccan ancestry, and Gergis’s family has Egyptian origins) and the roots they’ve put down in Southern California. In Bavel, they realize their goal. Nubbly duck ’nduja gilds some of the smoothest, most purely earthen hummus in America. Chermoula, preserved orange, smoked anchovy, and herbs wrap grilled dorade in a pleasing surround-sound of flavors. The flatbreads, the roasted lamb neck, the walnut and apricot variation on baklava from Gergis (who is a pastry chef): all sensational. The airy space is totally LA, featuring a suspended garden where vines tumble down from the ceiling. Israel’s melting-pot cuisine has proliferated in Southern California — and across the country — since the couple started planning the restaurant half a decade ago. But Bavel, instantly one of the finest in the genre, has arrived right on time.'",

That’s the way it’s done in Salamanca, Guanajuato. For more than half-century, “Momo” has been making artisanal carnitas, a trade he’s passed onto his children, ensuring the best carnitas in the U.S. are here to stay. Decades after serving carnitas to garment factory workers at 60th and Avalon in South Park, Carnitas El Momo ascended to become one of LA’s most popular street food operations, debuting a trailer in Boyle Heights in 2015. Now, the 82-year-old taquero, a recent heart attack and stroke survivor, is realizing a dream that he formed after leaving his family behind years ago in Salamanca. “I wanted the carnitas business to provide a living for my children and their children,” he says.’",

The restaurant succeeds far beyond mere buzz factor. Momofuku’s chef-auteur relocated to Los Angeles for his first West Coast project; the cooking is his communion with the region. Chang has always exercised a certain fluidity with cuisines — the ways they can stand alone and the ways they might intermingle — but Majordomo shows the chef at his confident prime. His framing of cultures and cuisines triumphs in early standouts like the sausage-stuffed peppers (a Korean-inspired recipe, though the filling is a recipe from Tennessee’s bacon master Allan Benton) and in large-format behemoths like smoked short rib presented with rice wrapping paper and a slew of condiments. This being Chang in the Golden State, there are stunning salads (perhaps tomatoes and stone fruits with sesame and basil) to offset all the overt meatiness.'",

The restaurant is unassuming in almost every way: Seating is limited to a scattering of industrial-grade patio tables, and the restaurant is tucked into a sleepy mini-mall where there seem to be more tenants than parking spaces. The general mood is one of extreme informality and friendliness. The restaurant’s menu of Oaxacan-inflected, Lebanese-inspired dishes is at its most compelling when it goes full-bore on its vaguely exotic-sounding premise of “Arabesque Oaxacan” cooking.' The Los Angles Times recommends the following dishes: Chicken shawarma taco, tabbouleh Oaxaca salad, Oaxacan hummus, falafel plate, and chorizo kebab.",
