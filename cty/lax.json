One bite, however, and the illusion of primness fades: The eggplant, marinated overnight in a burnt onion dashi before it is panko-breaded and deep-fried, delivers a dense, savory wallop. Its meaty quality is amplified by a thin scrim of sweet-savory Bull-Dog tonkatsu sauce, a beloved Japanese condiment that lands somewhere between A.1. and Worcestershire.

Known for their namesake, ½ pound burger, this is diner food to its core. The Denver Sandwich is an open-faced creation, with toast that holds a pepper-filled omelet and a thick, grilled slice of pineapple; your choice of potato salad or coleslaw comes on the side (get the potato salad). Fries are solid here—thick, lightly crunchy, and without an excessive amount of grease, which is quite possibly the only non-retro thing about this place.'",

The walls are plastered with posters and playbills commemorating African-American icons — some local, some international — everyone from Otis Redding to Redd Foxx to Malcolm X, along with hundreds of stickers and signs from local businesses and clubs stuck onto every empty surface. Motown tunes float through the air, while retro sitcoms play on a TV in the corner.'",
