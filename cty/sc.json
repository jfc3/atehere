They’re baked at a small bakery called Bake Room, run by Wade Taylor, who sources local grains to bake naturally leavened breads and pastries. Taylor’s morning bun is an absolute masterpiece, much lighter and flakier than the traditional bun, with a top that gets the old-fashioned doughnut treatment, tossed in cinnamon sugar. Eating it is something like hearing Marvin Gaye for the first time. The exterior of Taylor’s croissants shatter perfectly, and his chocolate chip monkey bread resembles miniature layered croissants more than cake, rendering everything I used to love and appreciate about monkey bread useless.’",
