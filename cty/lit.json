				"note": "The Root Cafe is a chill cafe with a patio offering sandwiches and salads made with locally sourced ingredients. The bright little diner’s mismatched tableware and napkins, indoor and outdoor dining and sweet, hip staff would be an asset anywhere; gems such as third-of-a-pound burgers featuring small-farmed, pasture-raised beef from Simon Farms, brats Farm Girl Meats’ pork, and an incredible curried chicken salad sandwich on an Arkansas Fresh Bakery bun. Also, consider ordering the old world brat with homemade sauerkraut.",
