				"note": "The Fold: Botanas and Bar is a bright and trendy taqueria in a converted gas station, with cocktails and modern takes on Mexican fare. Make sure to get the bison burrito or cornmeal waffle with pork on top and a sunny side up egg. From their website, 'There is always a story behind every good taco. The story behind ours goes back to 2010 in Austin, Texas, where the mobile food truck scene was alive and thriving. That experience inspired us to bring our inspirations back with us to The Rock. In 2012 we purchased what used to be a filling station, built-in 1960, in the heart of Little Rock. The mission was to take that experience and mold it with inspiration from cantinas in Mexico.'",

				"note": "North Bar is an eclectic menu ranging from P B and J Burger to the Vegan Loaded Tofu club. They have over 15 vegan items and offer gluten-free options as well from the local Dempsy Bakery. You should order the Arkansas BBQ Bologna Burger or the Kung Fu Bird, which is a sweet and sour chicken sandwich. From their website, 'We really wanted to open a great neighborhood bar and restaurant. We have over 16 beers on tap, most occupied by local breweries and an eclectic menu ranging from PB&J Burger to the Vegan Loaded Tofu club. We have over 15 vegan items and offer gluten-free options as well from the local Dempsy Bakery. Our Desserts come from Flywheel Pies in Prescott, Arkansas, in a variety of flavors. Our very own Park hill Blackberry Ale is made by The Water Buffalo Brewing Co., and for every Park Hill Blackberry pale ale sold, we give a $1 to the PHBMA to help improve the community and pay for the patio on the park, streets, roads, sidewalks and more.'",

				"note": "The Root Cafe is a chill cafe with a patio offering sandwiches and salads made with locally sourced ingredients. The bright little diner’s mismatched tableware and napkins, indoor and outdoor dining and sweet, hip staff would be an asset anywhere; gems such as third-of-a-pound burgers featuring small-farmed, pasture-raised beef from Simon Farms, brats Farm Girl Meats’ pork, and an incredible curried chicken salad sandwich on an Arkansas Fresh Bakery bun. Also, consider ordering the old world brat with homemade sauerkraut.",
