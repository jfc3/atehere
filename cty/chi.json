At Pacific Standard Time, his proven repertoire merges with a West Coast ethos, so that coils of chitarra snarl Dungeness crab and a salad starring milky stracciatella comes paired with Harry’s Berries strawberries, some of the finest fruit grown in California. But this is the Golden State of Wu-Bower’s own mind, informed by freethinking multiculturalism rather than an adherence to any one cuisine. So pork and shrimp dumplings can be ordered alongside the pasta, and a handsomely charred mushroom pizza arrives dotted with XO sauce and served with a winky side of ranch dressing. His showstopper is a large-format, two-course duck presentation perfumed with Middle Eastern flavors, including a cast-iron pot domed with pita dough and filled with duck-beef meatballs in a fragrant chickpea stew. Pastry chef Natalie Saben drives home the Midwest-meets-California ideology, with feel-good desserts like the huckleberry sundae and a chocolate tart with peanut dukkah.'",
