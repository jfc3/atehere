With an unparalleled work ethic and a love for food, they immigrated to the United States with the hope of one day owning their very own successful business.  After years of hard work, they were able to save up enough money to purchase their very own taco truck. Full of pride and eager to start a new chapter in their life, the taco truck quietly became a huge success. Every day more and more people waited in line to enjoy the best tacos in the city. Humbled and grateful by the sight of their success, they decided that the customers needed better dining accommodations. Once again, they took a risk by opening their first brick and mortar restaurant on Godown Road in Columbus, Ohio. The lines didn't slow down and steadily grew. Today, Los Guachos employees over 50 people and has three restaurants around Columbus and Gahanna along with the original humble taco truck that helped put their American dream in motion.
