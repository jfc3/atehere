You need to order the 'The Thurman Burger' which contains the following: overloaded with ham, saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, mozzarella and American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, banana peppers, and mayo with chips and a pickle spear. Plus, you need a side of their French fries. If you're super hungry get 'The Thurmanator' which is the same as the 'The Thurman Burger' but has not one but two three-quarters of a pound burger patties.",
