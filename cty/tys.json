				"note": "Asia Kitchen serves freshly prepared Chinese food. There is nothing fancy about the interior, and it is the food that you come for. Asia Kitchen isnâ€™t for everybody; but if you crave an authentic experience, you need to visit. The full menu, available all day is offered in both Chinese (Mandarin?) and English. The menu presents a slate of unfamiliar dishes: Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Beef with Sour Vegetable, etc.",
