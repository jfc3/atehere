				"note": "Asia Kitchen serves freshly prepared Chinese food. There is nothing fancy about the interior, and it is the food that you come for. Asia Kitchen isnâ€™t for everybody; but if you crave an authentic experience, you need to visit. The full menu, available all day is offered in both Chinese (Mandarin?) and English. The menu presents a slate of unfamiliar dishes: Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Beef with Sour Vegetable, etc.",

				"note": "From the Richy Kreme Do-Nuts website, 'In 1939 Marion Richardson moved to Blount County with his family. Prior to that, he and his brother were operating a doughnut franchise in Virginia. Saying he had a flour blend that would make a better doughnut, Mr. Richardson went back into the business. In 1948, Marion Richardson began serving doughnuts at a shop on Old Knoxville Highway across from Eagleton Ball Park. Richy Kreme Do-Nuts has become a Blount County tradition ever since.' When you are there, you need to eat one of their apple fritters along with a white cream-filled donut.",
