Unless you get to Bryant’s Breakfast when they open, plan on having to wait in line for an hour or more. I ordered two breakfast sandwiches, and my favorite was the Bologna with egg and cheese on a biscuit. From their website, ‘We have 10 employees at Bryant’s. Most of our employees have been with us for over ten years, with some over twenty years. We are primarily known in Memphis for our breakfast. Homemade biscuits. Country Ham. Omelets. Gravy, Grits. We have been serving plate lunches that have become very popular the past 3 or 4 years.’",

				"note": "Charlie Vergos' Rendezvous is a BBQ spot with an upstairs beer hall serving racks of smoked ribs and sausages dusted with dry rub. You need to order the lamb riblets, which is their sleeper dish. I still think about the lamb riblets when I talk about BBQ to people visiting Memphis. From their website, 'Memphis is the pork barbecue mecca of the world, and there are great joints in every nook and cranny of this town. We know how to eat right. And while everyone has a favorite, few can question that the Rendezvous is a quintessential Memphis experience. For over 70 years, the Vergos family has been serving their signature dry rub ribs in a basement through a downtown alley across from the Peabody Hotel. And while the world outside has changed considerably, very little has changed in that alley basement.'",

Back in 1912, the late Elmer “Doc” Dyer opened his own cafe and began to develop a secret cooking process for the uniquely delicious world famous burgers we still serve here today on Beale Street. Legend has it that the “secret” was Doc Dyer's ageless cooking grease. This famous grease, strained daily, has continued to produce our juicy Dyer's Burgers for almost a century now. When I was there, I ordered a double cheeseburger and fries, which means to patties and two pieces of cheese too.",
