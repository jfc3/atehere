				"note": "Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana is a casual local pizzeria chain serving a menu of coal-fired pies, beer, and wine since 1925. Oder the clam pizza along with original cheese and sauce. From the Eater website, 'If you've never had New Haven-style pizza, the thing to know about it is that the people who still make it have been making it for a very long time. They call it apizza, which is pronounced roughly, a-beets — from an old dialect once found among descendants of immigrants from the Amalfi coast circa the early 20th century — and they guard their recipes like family secrets. Frank Pepe, born in the town of Maiori just southwest of Naples, was one of those immigrants.'",

				"note": "From their website, ‘The Port of Call is a nautical-themed cocktail lounge and restaurant. The Port of Call hearkens back to the days of maritime excursions, exploring international cocktail culture and cuisine together, port by port. Voted one of the 24 Best Bars in America by Esquire magazine. Downstairs, you’ll find a laid-back pub serving beer and bar bites, complete with a shuffleboard table and arcade games. In the upper salon, enjoy a cocktail-driven dinner experience drawing from port cities near and far.’ From the Boston Eater website, ‘As evening arrives and you start to get thirsty, head to the Port of Call. Pick your vibe at two separate bars in the space: Upstairs offers the timeless elegance of a captain’s quarters, with light filtering through red velvet curtains across warm wood paneling and onto the centerpiece, a majestic curved bar made from salvaged ship wood. Downstairs at Dive Bar, there’s neon signage, a vinyl record collection, vintage games, a photo booth, and a diving suit in the corner. While Dive focuses on cold beer and simple cocktail builds, Port of Call’s upstairs drink list, led by director Jade Ayala, is more complex and tropical. On both levels, find the same top-notch food menu created by 2023 James Beard nominee Reneé Touponce, who works magic with cured local fish in particular. Order the bacalaitos — a golden, Puerto Rican salted fluke fritter served with ephemeral cilantro lime foam — tender adobo-marinated beef tongue, and a snappy smoked hot dog dressed with bonito aioli and kimchi in a light and tangy double-fermented bao bun. The Port of Call also hosts performances almost every night, from sultry jazz to disco drag shows; it’s a lively draw for visitors and locals alike.’ Brad recommends ordering the beef empanadas.",

Titus tweeted the following about Rawley’s Drive-In, ‘The Chili Cheese Dog at Rawley’s Drive-In (Fairfield, CT). A natural casing Hummel Bros wiener (beef/pork) is fried, then crisped on a hot flattop. It goes into a toasted split-top roll with a slice of White American cheese sitting underneath. Add onions.
