				"note": "Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana is a casual local pizzeria chain serving a menu of coal-fired pies, beer, and wine since 1925. Oder the clam pizza along with original cheese and sauce. From the Eater website, 'If you've never had New Haven-style pizza, the thing to know about it is that the people who still make it have been making it for a very long time. They call it apizza, which is pronounced roughly, a-beets — from an old dialect once found among descendants of immigrants from the Amalfi coast circa the early 20th century — and they guard their recipes like family secrets. Frank Pepe, born in the town of Maiori just southwest of Naples, was one of those immigrants.'",
