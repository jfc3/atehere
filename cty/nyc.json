Hajji’s is said to be the birthplace of the historic sandwich, which has since made its way into hip-hop lyrics, Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown, Whole Foods, and April Bloomfield’s upscale Upper West Side butcher shop, White Gold. Essentially the New York version of a Philly cheesesteak, the pressed hero sandwich is stacked with chopped and griddled ground beef, melted American cheese, peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Though many Harlem bodegas serve their own iteration of the chopped cheese, the one from Hajji’s started it all.’",

Compare a range of steaks and different aging times via one of two prix fixe options: the “butcher’s feast” of four cuts for $48 or the $125-per-person, 10-course &ldquo;omakase.&rdquo; Both end with galbi, traditional Korean marinated short ribs, and both cleverly lighten and balance typical steakhouse gluttony by including banchan (an array of vegetable-based sides), lettuce wraps with condiments, and, to sidestep classic gut-bomb desserts, a final paper cup filled with vanilla soft serve drizzled with soy caramel.",

From the Eater website, ‘Restaurateur Roni Mazumdar and chef Chintan Pandya are building an empire without a playbook, let alone precedent. Devoted champions of homestyle Indian cooking under the moniker Unapologetic Foods, they cemented their status as hitmakers with their third restaurant, Dhamaka. Diners who fell for the street food and canteen-style cooking at Adda (the duo’s 2019 Best New Restaurant) clamored to get a taste of Dhamaka’s homage to rural and provincial fare. When it opened mid-pandemic, it instantly became one of the most sought-after reservations in New York City. Dhamaka brings crowds, but it doesn’t pander to them. Instead, Pandya is uncompromising in his dedication to the bold and complex range of flavors in Indian cuisine. He drapes a velvety cashew cream over from-scratch paneer. It’s equally appealing to diners most comfortable ordering saag paneer as it is to those looking to try the fiery gurda kapoora, chile-laced goat kidney, and testicles, the kind of dish rarely seen in a trendy Manhattan restaurant. From a star anise-infused scotch cocktail garnished with a  coconut water ice cube to the $190 bacchanalian rabbit feast, Dhamaka  proves that a bucket-list dinner doesn’t have to involve unwieldy  Eurocentric tasting menus — and shows Mazumdar and Pandya together are not finished redefining Indian restaurants in America.’",

The flaky, layered dough comes filled with cream, and the bakery prepares a new flavor every month. Those in the know will order ahead to cut the line.

This essential ingredient was introduced to the Cajuns by the Choctaw Indians in the 18th century. The centerpiece of our menu is Tiny’s Gumbo™, inspired by the owner’s grandfather, Aubrey “Tiny” Gaines (who was anything but). Tiny had a larger-than-life presence and believed there was nothing better than shellfish and spice. While Gumbo is our establishment’s signature dish, dining at File is an educational feast of the culinary subtleties of Cajun and Creole food — which are as independent as they are intertwined within a complex and rich culinary history. Filé Gumbo Bar combines slow-cooked and flavor-rich bases with quality proteins, simmered in steam kettles in front of our guests. This approach allows each guest to customize their dish and the Kettle Chefs to interact with patrons in a way that few other restaurants achieve.’",

'At this history-repeats-itself moment, when French restaurants have come roaring back into vogue, chef-owners Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson differentiate their Tribeca hit in strategic ways. Nasr and Hanson have spent their careers interpreting Gallic cooking; their resumes include Balthazar and Daniel. Here, the menu actually meanders in and out of the French lexicon. Soupe de Poisson, Provencal-style lamb stew, and cote de boeuf hobnob alongside Spanish tortilla with trout roe (a must-try) and spaghetti with bottarga. The crux, though, is that Nasr and Hanson excel at cooking that lulls you into a bistro state of mind — at once animated and at ease. Also? The front-of-house staff is downright enchanting. While power summits transpire in the dim rear dining room, where prime-time reservations are all but impossible to secure, most of us gather in the sunny, swank front bar hoping for an unreserved seat. Hosts and servers make everyone feel genuinely welcome; they’re happy to grab would-be diners a cocktail or glass of rosé (from Jorge Riera’s impeccable list of natural wines) to ease the wait. The acts of small kindness at Frenchette feel disarmingly radical. Shouldn’t customers always be treated this graciously?'",

Known as the Japanese “soul food,” a bowl of ramen contains that special something—the trifecta of soup, noodles, and toppings—that brings forth the cosmos and transcends all culinary ethnicities and nationalities. The basic ramen broth is derived from the essence of pork, chicken, beef, or seafood and is seasoned with soy sauce, salt, miso, and other various ingredients, depending on the chef’s personal preference. The noodles are made with flour, eggs, kansui (an alkaline water that provides a chewy texture), among other ingredients, and can vary greatly in thickness, length, form, and texture. Toppings such as chashu (simmered pork) and tamago (flavored boiled egg) are also commonly used, as well as a number of vegetables like sweet corn, bean sprouts, or dried seaweed.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

From the New York City Eater website, 'Keens Steakhouse is known as the last bastion of the mutton chop, a dish that has fallen entirely out of favor in the rest of the city's chophouses. According to executive chef William Rodgers, who has helmed the kitchen at Keen's for the last decade, it continues to be amongst the most popular menu items. However, the mutton chop served today is not your father's mutton chop. It might not even be mutton at all, but lamb. This Midtown steakhouse that opened in 1885 used to be home to a famous theatre and literary group, and after that, a pipe club. Dozens of pipes still line the restaurant, giving it a warm, unique vibe, not like any other restaurant in the city. The signature order here is the mutton chop. The restaurant also sells a smaller portion as a $29 as special. This classic midtown steakhouse has a fireplace in the pub room adjacent to the bar, where diners can choose between the regular menu and a more casual pub menu available throughout the dining room. Though you can ask for a reservation near the fireplace, it’s not guaranteed.’",

Buying direct and fulfilling from origin allows us to keep our prices lower - supplying pinnacle-grade tea at reasonable prices direct to our customers.

The chicken salad with bacon is a classic, heaped high enough ($8) with mayo-laced poultry, and stacked with enough bacon accented with shredded beets and a frond or two of purslane, that it’s more of a small lunch than the kind of canape passed around at parties. Like all the smørrebrod here, much attention is paid to artistic presentations. Figuring out how to eat them is half the fun.' More from their website, 'Smør was founded in 2019 by two Danes named Sebastian. Both were born and partially raised in Denmark before moving aboard.

From the New York City Eater website, ‘The excellent smoked fish selection at this UWS institution, founded by Louis Zabar in 1934 and now co-owned by his sons Saul and Stanley Zabar, is mainly sourced from Greenpoint’s Acme Smoked Fish factory in Greenpoint. Saul, now 89, has been known to make regular visits to Greenpoint to select the finest fish. Head into the grocery store and first stop by the fish counter to grab a number before going to the bakery to pick a bagel. With that in hand, return to the fish counter so the guys slicing the melt-in-your-mouth fish can make a sandwich.’",

Order tacos with whatever meats are available that day (the selection rotates); keep an eye out for the chorizo with potato strewn over two blue corn tortillas.

We make bagels the old-fashioned way: hand-rolled and kettle-boiled, using only unbromated and unbleached flours and a touch of malt syrup. Our New York bagels have a golden brown exterior, a dense, chewy interior and are generously seeded on both sides (no skimping!). By partnering with the country’s most respected makers, including Acme Smoked Fish, La Colombe Coffee, Guss’ Pickles, and others, we create the city’s most delicious bagel sandwiches. We cater and deliver throughout Manhattan and ship our bagels and brunch kits nationwide via Goldbelly.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
