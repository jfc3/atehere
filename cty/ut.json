				"note": "Burger Bar serves handcrafted hamburgers, fries, and towering milkshakes at a small, old-school walk-up counter. They make their own buns. You should order the elk and/or buffalo burgers. Burger Bar triple fries their french fries. From their website, 'If you mention the Burger Bar to someone you may get a range of different comments, from the fresh taste of the food, the great hand sliced and breaded onion rings, the handmade deep fried mushrooms, the towering thick milkshakes to the signature “Big Ben” named after the founder.  But you will always hear comments about the history of the place.  How they remember coming there with their parents, or after a date on a Saturday night, or how they loved to hang out with their friends after the ball game at the High School.'",
