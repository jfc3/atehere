				"note": "2 Amy's Neapolitan Pizzeria is a bustling wood-oven pizzeria serves innovative Neapolitan-style pies and Italian wine by the glass. They were the first certified Neapolitan pizza place in the United States. Their wood-fired pizza is the best, but their side dishes are even better. The meatballs cooked in the wood-fired oven are fantastic along with the rabbit stuffed with baby broccoli rabe and many more items that change with the season. From the Washington, DC Eater website, ‘Many chefs frequent 2 Amys on their days off, endorsing an unpretentious family restaurant that remains the standard for Neapolitan pizza in the District. The visibly scorched, wood-fired pies have attracted obsessives for 20 years. During the pandemic, 2 Amys owner Peter Pastan installed a second pizza oven in the main dining room to fuel a transition to takeout. But the beloved neighborhood spot near the National Cathedral has welcomed regulars back on-site with indoor and patio dining (walk-ins only). A longtime standard-bearer for Neapolitan pizza in the District, 2 Amys has “kid-friendly” down to a science. In addition to the pies and a rotating menu of excellent Italian small plates, the restaurant offers crayons and paper to ward away boredom. Its well-known pizzas promise to please hungry kids and parents alike.’",

The other things I have been known to order is their meatball sub, but my favorite is the create your own cured meat sub.

A favorite of nearby workers, the deli keeps limited daytime hours and is closed Sundays and Mondays.

Their focus brings welcome attention to a span of the world whose wondrous cuisines remain perplexingly undersung in the United States. The restaurant’s centerpiece hearth — a blazing fire pit outfitted with grills and two clay ovens for baking delightfully misshapen, floppy-crackery flatbreads — sets a dramatic scene. Zoom in on dishes that particularly reflect Previte’s Lebanese heritage, including spreads like muhammara, a glossy paste of walnuts and red pepper twanged with pomegranate molasses, and hindbe, lemony dandelion greens textured with fried shallots.

In addition to the lunch choices, diners can opt for the meat or veggie platter -- a chicken or vegetable curry with sides of vegetables, rice, and naan. Booming at lunch, this small restaurant dishes up adapted versions of Indian classics. As its name suggests, Indian naan bread accompanies nearly every item on the menu. Tikka sandwiches, the most popular items, include chicken, lamb, shrimp, and veggie varieties. The same tikka fillings are also available on an over-dressed Caesar salad.'",
