				"note": "El Guero Canelo Restaurant is a series of food trailers doling out Sonoran-style hot dogs and Mexican street foods. From their website, 'Daniel Contreras opened his first hot dog stand in Tucson in 1993. As a boy, he ate, slept, and breathed baseball (he was nearly a champion at 12), now he puts that same drive into Sonoran food. He owns and operates three El Guero Canelo restaurants, a meat market in Tucson, a bakery and tortilla factory in Magdalena (he had to be sure the quality was just right).' Alton recommends ordering the Sonoran dog at the El Guero Canelo Restaurant. Titus tweeted 'Sonoran Dog from El GÃ¼ero Canelo (Tucson, AZ). Bacon-wrapped frank, pinto beans, grilled and raw onion, tomato, mayo, mustard, jalapeno sauce on a local bolillo roll. Originally a street-side stand, it won a James Beard &ldquo;American Classic&rdquo; award a few years back. Since 1993.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
