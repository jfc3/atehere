				"note": "Emma Jean's Holland Burger Cafe is a storied 1947 diner dishing up American comfort classics and big burgers in an old-timey setting. Emma Jean's son and daughter keep the tradition alive with their mother's recipes. This legendary trucker paradise aims for a 'it simple' menu that's stayed true to its roots for more than 60 years. You need to order the homemade biscuits and the all-American Brian Burger.",
