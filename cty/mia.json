				"note": "Blackbrick Chinese and Dim Sum is a chef-owned Chinese restaurant serving dim sum, mains, and wine in a funky, contemporary space. From their website, ‘Blackbrick stylized but playful interior was designed by Chef Hales himself and menu was created from his travels in China, experience in NYC and collaboration with Chef Feng, his Chinese Chef. The design and menu speak to the mind of Chef Hales, funky, adventurous, and a focus on good homey food.’ From the Food Network website, ‘For a modern take on regional Chinese cuisine, head to Blackbrick. Dim sum options include crystal shrimp dumplings, chicken siu mei, cumin-lamb dumplings, and barbecued pork buns. Noodles are made in-house for dishes like the dan dan mian, which tosses spicy Szechuan pork ragu with bucatini. Guy is obsessed with dan dan mian. “I can’t figure out how to get it in my face fast enough,” said Guy between bites. The dishes they recommend are Har Gow Shrimp Dumpling, Xinjiang Cumin-Lamb Dumpling, Dan Dan Mian, Gong Bao Rabbit, Grandma’s Red Oxtail, and General Tso’s Florida Gator.",

You need to order the Big Ragout Sandwich which is served in a hollowed-out crusty bread, with pork and veal shoulder, and brisket along with provolone and parmesan cheese. From the Miami Eater website, 'Big fan of NY strip? The prime, juicy patty in Blue Collar’s dry-aged cheeseburger is accompanied by melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. It’s served on a semi-sweet Portuguese muffin, a satisfying combination with every bite. Comfort food done right is the ethos behind longtime Miami favorite Blue Collar. Its menu boasts an impressive list of 20 vegetable dishes and a chocolate cake so decadent that it comes with its own glass of milk.'",
