				"note": "NOTE - Only open Sunday from mid-April to Mid-Deceber. While strolling through Maryland's largest producers-only market (producers-only meaning all vendors make what they sell), shoppers can revel at the sight of a vast quantity of foods, including crisp seasonal fruits and vegetables, poultry, seafood, beef, pork, lamb, rabbit, fresh baked goods, flavorful herbs and organically raised and produced milk, yogurt, butter, eggs and cheese products. Additionally, dozens of food vendors add spice to the market with multicultural cuisine such as popular pit beef sandwiches, omelets and breakfast burritos, crepes, wood fired pizzas, pies and quiches, soups, noodles and dumplings."
