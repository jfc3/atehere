Shoppers can revel at the sight of a vast quantity of foods, including crisp seasonal fruits and vegetables, poultry, seafood, beef, pork, lamb, rabbit, fresh baked goods, flavorful herbs and organically raised and produced milk, yogurt, butter, eggs and cheese products. Additionally, dozens of food vendors add spice to the market with multi cultural cuisines such as traditional pit beef sandwiches, omelets and breakfast burritos, crepes, wood fired pizzas, pies and quiches, soups, noodles, and dumplings. If you like fresh horse radish, you need to find the guy selling turkey burgers near the information booth. His horseradish will clean out your sinuses. It's that strong. <strong>NOTE</strong> - Only open Sunday's from mid-April to Mid-December.",
