Our butcher, our baker, and our pickle maker are proudly based in Detroit. Our food is always fresh, and our ingredients come from local, family-run businesses, just like ours. Our small, white porcelain pill-box diner is a mainstay on Woodward Avenue, the first paved road in America. It is the oldest operating restaurant and one of the oldest businesses in Birmingham, Michigan. The name Hunter House dates back to when the road was a bypass named Hunter Boulevard, named after John W. Hunter, who helped found Birmingham in 1819. Hunter Blvd. eventually became part of Woodward Ave., as it stretched out from Detroit.’ From the Detroit Eater website, ‘Nestled up against Woodward Avenue and surrounded by relatively new construction, Hunter House Hamburgers’ bright-white hamburger stand is a holdout from a different era. This blue-collar spot specializes in small, greasy-griddled sliders served on steamed buns with pickles and caramelized onions. Dine inside, sit on the patio, or grab a sack full to go.’",

Little has changed since then. There have been only three owners since Scotty, (Uncle) Sean Gilmore, and the current owner Harry Barber. Harry has worked at Scotty’s, as the  regulars call it, since 1966.’ From the Detroit Eater website, ‘Scotty Simpson’s has faithfully met Detroiters’ fish and chips needs since  1950. Though the Brightmoor restaurant offers options such as fried smelt and frog legs, the house specialty is Nova Scotian cod and chips fried in a secret batter recipe with fries, a roll, and tartar sauce. Don’t miss the pies, made fresh every Friday.’ Titus retweeted ‘Best fish and chips in the United States. Not surprising because fish and  chips are very popular across the river in Ontario.’",

You need to order the Porker, which has a house-ground pork patty, house-made Michigan maple bacon and house-made hotlinks or any of their other BBQ: brisket, chicken, and pork. From their website, ‘It begins and ends in the backlot, with a green hickory smoker that’s on a constant low-temp tear with an assortment of meats. It’s a ritual that starts with a careful rub and ends only when we think it’s time to pull the meat from the bath of smoke we surround it with. Pork butt. Brisket. Spare ribs. Back ribs. Whole birds and chicken wings alike. And bacon. Lots of bacon. Slow-cooked bacon ready to be cut in from thick slabs into magical planks. Thank you, pig, for all you do for us. It is a menu that’s rustic in its delivery and refined in its care. And it’s crafted with hickory on the smoke side and apple and cherry wood on the pizza side. These aren’t conveyor belt byproducts these bear little resemblance to the frozen disks of surplus cheese that have come to pass for pizza today. No, Pizza Coco pies are fired in an 800-degree inferno until the cheese caramelizes, and the ingredients bake into something incredible. No two pies are the same. It’s the kind of oven, the kind of crafted pie, that can take two or three of your favorite toppings and deliver them a thousand different ways.’",
