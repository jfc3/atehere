Enjoy a hot cup of coffee freshly roasted by our neighbors at PennyCup Coffee. Feel free to take a load off and let the outside world melt away as the entire process of making yeasted doughnuts by hand rolls out before your eyes in our open kitchen. Most importantly, let us share with you our favorite pastry at what we believe to be its finest moment: seconds out of the fryer, glazed, and delivered right to you. Our hope is that when you bite into one of our delicately crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside doughnuts, you will be escorted to the glorious realm of the simplest of pleasures, the place where our fondest childhood memories live.'",
