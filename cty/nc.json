If you like biscuits, you should get them with your breakfast. From their website, 'Angie Mikus shares that same passion for good food and good company. In 20 years of waiting tables at local restaurants, she developed a loyal following. Customers would wait to sit in her section even if other tables were empty, and they followed her whenever she switched jobs. But Angie always had a dream of running her own place. “I had an idea of how I think people should be treated – a place where people could sit and talk and stay all day if they want to.” Angie finally got the opportunity in September 2011 when she opened Angie’s Restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Green’s Garner Grill. Angie and her staff continue with the same desires that Mr. Green had – to enjoy good food and good times with family and friends.'",
