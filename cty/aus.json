Delaney from Bon Appetit (YouTube) recommends the breakfast tacos and the wild game tacos with either boar chorizo and venison too. From their website, 'Tacos start with tortillas. We use locally-grown heritage varieties of dried corn, which is then nixtamalized in post oak ash from our grills. The nixtamal is then ground daily into masa dough to produce a fresh, simple, and nutritious corn tortilla. Our flour is sourced from area farms and milled locally before being mixed with our traditional house-rendered lard for tortillas and house-baked telera rolls. Wild game, namely the destructive and ubiquitous feral hog, along with Hill Country venison, provides the foundation for our tacos. The sustainability and availability of these lean, rich, and wild meats make them an excellent example of our regional food culture. In addition to wild game, our menu will reflect some of the finest pastured animals from local farms such as ducks, turkeys, and quail. Seafood from the Gulf and rivers of central Texas also find a spot on our menu. Equally as important, our menu showcases the vibrant vegetables, fruits, herbs, and cheeses produced around Austin.'",

If the Texas sun had a fragrance, it would smell like the small, speckled tortillas that cradle confit brisket tacos with “black magic oil” (made from sesame and smoked Morita chiles) and come alongside grilled fish with bacon salsa or a whopping goat shoulder cooked barbacoa-style. Nuñez alchemizes the dough into half a dozen other magnetic variations, including tlacoyos (plush dough pockets) filled with pork belly carnitas, and incredibly thin blue-corn tostadas to add crunch to gorgeous red prawn aguachile.
