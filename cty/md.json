Additionally, dozens of food vendors add spice to the market with multi-cultural cuisines. These include traditional pit beef sandwiches, omelets, breakfast burritos, crepes, wood-fired pizzas, pies and quiches, soups, noodles, and dumplings. If you like fresh horseradish, you need to find the guy selling turkey burgers near the information booth. His horseradish will clean out your sinuses. It's that strong.",
