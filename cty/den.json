				"note": "Dae Gee (which means pig in Korean) is a Korean BBQ restaurant progressively blending Korean food tradition with American culture. We combine the freshest ingredients, endless flavor, and a fun atmosphere to give you the exceptional dining experience you deserve. They serve unlimited BBQ along with unlimited sides for both lunch and dinner. From their website, 'Joe Kim loves it when someone comes to one of his Dae Gee Korean BBQ restaurants and truly pigs out. In fact, Dae Gee translates to “pig” in Korean, and “Pig Out” is its unofficial motto. So one of Kim’s favorite customers is Ethan Tsai. “He used to come into our first spot and really pig out,” Kim says. Back then, Kim had only one location in Westminster, and Tsai was still an organic chemistry professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Today, however, Kim owns five Dae Gees, with a sixth on the way, and is getting ready to start up a pandemic-inspired food-shipping business, while Tsai has taken his skills and his Ph.D. to Tivoli Brewing, where he is now the director of brewery operations. <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

You need to order the fried chicken and the chicken Chicharrones; fried chicken skin served with a pinto bean hummus. From their website, 'We took the time to do our homework and get the best equipment around so that our fried chicken is perfectly juicy and crispy every single time. We start with humanely raised, all-natural chicken, brine it for hours, give it a dip in buttermilk, dredge it in seasoned gluten-free flour, and then pressure fry it to crisp golden perfection. We rest it for a few minutes to let the flavors meld and season it with our spicy goodness shaker. All that love, care, and attention to detail makes our bird simply mouth-wateringly delicious.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
