From their website, 'Joe Kim loves it when someone comes to one of his Dae Gee Korean BBQ restaurants and truly pigs out. In fact, Dae Gee translates to “pig” in Korean, and “Pig Out” is its unofficial motto. So one of Kim’s favorite customers is Ethan Tsai. “He used to come into our first spot and really pig out,” Kim says. Back then, Kim had only one location in Westminster, and Tsai was still an organic chemistry professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Today, however, Kim owns five Dae Gees, with a sixth on the way, and is getting ready to start up a pandemic-inspired food-shipping business, while Tsai has taken his skills and his Ph.D. to Tivoli Brewing, where he is now the director of brewery operations. <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

Although converting from conventional to organic soil is difficult and time-consuming, we have found it to be effective in combating the diseases and weeds once controlled by harmful chemicals.'

With a background in science, Michael Jones is always experimenting with and monitoring the soil. Throughout the season, the Joneses will use a combination of techniques like cattle grazing and cover cropping. The Joneses provide potato medleys to Whole Foods Market stores in the Mountain West Region, working closely with regional foragers Kenny Meyer and Darcy Landis.'
