				"note": "The Big Apple Inn is an institution of old-school Southern sandwiches from Jackson, MS, which have 'smokes' (sausage), 'ears' (pig ears), and tamales along with a whole lot of history and hospitality. The sausage sandwich and the pig sandwich were great and one of the best things I ate on my 13-day tour of the south. From the Eater websire, 'Geno Lee’s sandwich shop (The Big Apple Inn) on historic Farish Street in Jackson, Mississippi that’s known for serving the best pig ears in the area, as well as ground sausage sandwiches served on lightly fried buns. Big Apple is also known among locals as Big John’s after Lee’s great-grandfather Juan “Big John” Mora, who opened the restaurant in an old grocery store space after making money selling tamales from a cart on the same street.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

				"note": "Bully’s Restaurant is a venerable, unpretentious eatery dishing out soul food such as beef ribs, fried chicken, and catfish. Make sure to get yourself some greens. From the Food Network website, ‘Owner Tyrone Bully built this joint by hand from the ground up, and he puts the same care into every rack of ribs he serves. Each rack is dry-rubbed and marinated for three days to start. Smoking the ribs over hickory and cherry woods and steaming them in their own juices create bold, smoky notes and fall-off-the-bone tenderness. A coating of Bully’s barbecue sauce adds a punch of flavor. Food Network recommends ordering the beef and pork rib combo.’",

				"note": "Mayflower Cafe is a landmark eatery dating to 1935 featuring Greek-inspired seafood and steak dishes in retro digs. The Mayflower began as a hamburger stand, started by a pair of Greek immigrants and friends from the deeply-Orthodox island of Patmos. From their website, 'Since its inception in 1935, the Mayflower Cafe has become synonymous with good taste and good times in Jackson, MS. As the oldest operating restaurant in the capital city, the classic, Greek-inspired seafood and steak menu has been passed down through the Kountouris family from generation to generation. A traditional, nightly gathering spot for locals and visitors alike, Mayflower Cafe is a downtown landmark and is often featured in the works of area artists. Many celebrities—from international superstars to local trendsetters—have chosen the Mayflower Cafe as a favorite stop in Jackson.'",
