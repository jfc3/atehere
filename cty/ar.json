The story behind ours goes back to 2010 in Austin, Texas, where the mobile food truck scene was alive and thriving. That experience inspired us to bring our inspirations back with us to The Rock. In 2012 we purchased what used to be a filling station, built-in 1960, in the heart of Little Rock. The mission was to take that experience and mold it with inspiration from cantinas in Mexico.'",

				"note": "Jones Bar-B-Q Diner is a barbecue joint in Marianna, Arkansas, that has been open since at least the 1910s. According to business guide Black Business, it is believed to be the country's oldest black-owned restaurant. In 2012 it was recognized by the James Beard Foundation as an &ldquo;American Classic&rdquo;. Their hours are from 7:00 AM until the food runs out. There is no menu because all Jones BBQ Diner serves is a pork BBQ sandwich on Wonder Bread. Jones Barbecue has been a part of the food culture in the Arkansas Delta for more than a century. The Southern Foodways Alliance, an organization &ldquo;dedicated to the documentation and celebration of the diverse food cultures of the American South,&rdquo; believes Jones Barbecue to be the oldest African-American-owned restaurants in the South and possibly the nation. James Harold Jones, the current owner and pitmaster, says it started with his grandfather’s Uncle Joe. His grandfather and father followed Uncle Joe into the smoking business, selling barbecue out of their homes. It was Jones’s father Hubert that started the diner in 1964. Jones started working in the restaurant when he was 14. He told me the only time his father would let him skip school &ldquo;was when I was working in the diner.&rdquo; On March 13, 2012, the James Beard Foundation designated Jones Bar-B-Q Diner as an America’s Classic.",

From their website, 'A celebration of our favorite dishes from India’s varied regions and communities, we source high-quality ingredients, using many authentic and seasonal products.  Our primary focus is real food, created in our kitchen with attention to preparation and freshness.  While Indian cuisine has about a million ingredients, once everything is cleaned, diced, and spiced, the cooking process is fairly simple: a few minutes in our wood-burning oven, or prepared in small batches throughout the day using classical cooking techniques.' John T. Edge said on his Twitter, 'Set in a former Wendy’s, now decorated with marigolds and elephants, on the edge of Fayetteville in NWA, Khana Grill is the project of &ldquo;Lisa, who descends from Choctaw people in Oklahoma, and Abhijeet, who emigrated from the city of Chennai on the Bay of Bengal.&rdquo;'",
