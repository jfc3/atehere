The Big Bad Smokehouse pulls double duty creating the items for our charcuterie program, and choucroute garni gets a second chance with collards and pickled peaches. Raw oysters arrive daily from all over the country, adding a unique touch to the glass tiled oyster bar that anchors our lower dining room. Top shelf whiskies and an extensive glass wine program round out an inviting and cozy bar setting likened to an “English Hunt Club.” We’ve got live music and late-night to keep you entertained. Chef Vishwesh Bhatt won the 2019 James Beard Award as Best Chef-South.' From the Eater website, 'Currently the most bustling of John Currence's restaurants, Snackbar is a bistro that blends the cooking of France, the deep South and, thanks to chef Vishwesh Bhatt, India. Expect everything from fried boudin balls to salmon tikka.'",
