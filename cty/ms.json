From the Big Bad Breakfast website, 'The brainchild of James Beard award-winning chef John Currence, Big Bad Breakfast, gives the proper respect to “the most important meal of the day.” Enjoy Big Bad Breakfast staples such as custom-created meats, fresh biscuits and preserves, locally roasted coffee, and some of the best cocktails you’ll find anywhere. We wear our “Big Bad” name as a badge of honor and take special pride in serving all your Southern favorites with the creativity and technique that only a skilled, world-renowned chef can bring to the table. Chef John Currence always had a love affair with breakfast. Whether it was scrambled eggs and toast before school with his family, his grandmother’s box mix pancakes with Louisiana cane syrup, bacon and egg sandwiches with his dad at Allgood’s diner in Uptown New Orleans or Sunday brunch at Commander’s Palace in the Garden District, the first meal of the day was always a driving forcing in our founder’s life.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have other locations around the country in the south.",

Doe’s Eat Place tells the complicated story of Italian immigration, Delta foodways, and Mississippi social history. In the 1930s, the restaurant’s founder, Dominick “Doe” Signa, was working at the Greenville Air Base, where he acquired a recipe for hot tamales from an unnamed co-worker. Doe left the air base in 1941 to take over the grocery store that his father opened in 1903. And he soon began selling the hot tamales he made form this recipe to the neighborhood’s largely black clientele. Word spread and the white community came calling for Doe’s tamales, as well as traditional Italian fare such as spaghetti and meatballs.'",
