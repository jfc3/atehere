				"note": "From the Button and Co. Bagels website, 'It's a classic bagel shop inspired by Katie Button's childhood in New Jersey and rooted in Asheville's Appalachian tradition. With a focus on sustainability and seasonality, bagels are made onsite using a house-made sourdough starter and blend of local, single variety flours from Asheville grain miller, Carolina Ground. Guests choose from plain, everything, rye, salt, benne seed, seeded, and fig and sorghum bagels, and a variety of cream cheese, fruit preserves and spreads. Open for breakfast and lunch, Button and Co. Bagels offers sandwiches such as an Egg and Cheese with Benton's Country Ham, Pastrami on Rye, Classic Gravlax and Sable rubbed in wild sumac among many other options. Pair bagels with Counter Culture Coffee, a house-made and bottled soda, freshly-pressed orange juice or homemade chocolate milk.'",
