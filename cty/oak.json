				"note": "Reem's California (Fruitvale) is a counter-serve bakery and cafe with outdoor seats that serve Arab flatbreads, meze, pastries, and coffee. From Reem's website, 'In 2010, the dream of Reem's was born at the doorstep of a street corner bakery in Beirut, Lebanon. The scent of za'atar, yeasted bread, and sweet orange blossom syrup right out of the oven and the sounds of laughter and chatter in Arabic all around me conjured up memories of my childhood and my yearning to create home and community in the United States. On a soul searching trip to Lebanon and Syria, I decided to bring this experience to the Bay. I wanted to bring more than just a bakery. I wanted to recreate the sights, sounds, tastes, and aromas of the streets of Damascus and Beirut, and at the same time, a space that feels familiar and inviting to all cultures. I wanted to create a sense of home.'",
