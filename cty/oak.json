You need to order the fried chicken sandwich with home-made coke slaw.

Her sandwich is an Oakland urban legend that precedes the latest fried chicken sandwich hype, made with buttermilk-brined breast meat and a jalapeño slaw. Use both hands, and don’t forget to grab napkins. Don’t skip out on a cookie or a pie slice if you’ve still got room.’",

The menu features an extensive selection of authentic Louisiana Creole dishes that are prepared in-house from scratch. The Ain’t Gator Po’ Boy that subs alligator with house-made seitan and battered mushrooms, plus all of the fixins, then tops it off with their savory “swamp sauce” is a favorite, but make sure you add a couple of sides to your order, like the Creole Mac with glazed semolina noodles and house-made cheeze that’s garnished with a zesty gremolata mixture.’",
