				"note": "Kings Bakery specializes in Mediterranean gourmet flatbreads and sandwiches. They are known for our phenomenal shawarmas and Manou-wiches(cheese bread sandwiches). From the Detroit Eater website, 'The bakery is known as the “home of the manouwich,” a Middle Eastern cheese pie made into a rolled sandwich that was recently featured in an episode of Ugly Delicious on Netflix. There are long lines for the manouwich, which comes in 17 varieties; the traditional maneesh comes in 44 options. The 55-seat bakery, which opened in 2013, is undoubtedly busiest during Ramadan. “We always have a line,” chef and co-owner Hassan Houssaiky says.'",
