We began as a donut stand operating off a tricycle near the Durham Farmer's Market in 2011 and have since grown into a bustling counter-service restaurant and bakery with a full menu of breakfast and lunch fare, including soups, salads, sandwiches, and of course, donuts. Monuts takes an updated approach to the American breakfast and lunch, pairing bold ethnic flavors with seasonal and local ingredients. Whether you’re looking for a hot breakfast on a cold day, a crisp fresh salad at the height of summer, or a handcrafted pastry or espresso to get you through your afternoon, Monuts has you covered. You won’t find any premade mixes or artificial flavorings in our food, though—everything we sell is made from scratch, by hand and with natural, high-quality ingredients. Breads and pastries are baked fresh daily, and sandwiches are made to order—if it seems simple, that’s because the best food often is.' From the Eater website, 'One of the hottest doughnut shops in the country, Monuts Donuts has taken in doughnuts from small tables at farmer's markets to this insanely popular downtown Durham brick-and-mortar shop. The menu of cake and yeast doughnuts change daily, with flavors ranging from a classic apple cider to the creative chocolate chai.'",
