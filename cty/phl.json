Naturally, Beck’s offers New Orleans classics like gumbo, jambalaya, étouffée, and the beloved muffuletta sandwich, but they also bring a Cajun spin to morning with breakfast po’ boys like steak and egg with salsa and a taste of the South with deep-fried mac and cheese and shrimp and crawdad pasta. Stop by on Wednesdays or Sundays for freshly fried beignets to go with your morning coffee. Can’t make it in until lunch? Try the Train Wreck Po’ Boy, stuffed with andouille, steak, salami, cheese, and onion. Wreck or no, it’s worth it.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

Our food menu both complements the beer and expands the notion of what pub food can be. “The gastropub that started it all with a focus on great local craft beer and serious food still captures a certain super-bar magic in the moody, rambling rooms of its Northern Liberties tavern,” mentions Craig Laban in his revisit to Standard Tap. Our menu features a wide selection of hearty dishes using seasonal ingredients and local produce. We are proud to support initiatives like Pennsylvania’s Buy Fresh Buy Local movement and urban agriculture from Greensgrow Farms.’",

				"note": "Tommy Di Nic's crowds pack this venerable Reading Terminal Market sandwich counter celebrated for its roast pork and make sure to get sharp provolone on your sandwich. Their roast pork with aged provolone is world famous, and the meatball or the roast beef subs aren't bad either. From the Reading Terminal Market website, ‘Tommy Nicolosi’s culinary legacy began in 1918 when his Grandfather Gaetano opened a butcher shop in South Philly. On occasion, Gaetano would cook big specialty roasts for customers in the garage out back. This eventually led to an off-shoot sandwich business, and in the late 1970s, DiNic’s Roast Pork and Beef was born. Tommy DiNic’s is now in its fourth generation, as Tommy owns and runs the shop with his son, Joey. With a deep respect for the past and an eager eye on the future, Joey has built upon DiNic’s lineup of classic Italian sandwiches to include new favorites like the slow-roasted brisket of beef and Italian-style pulled pork. The Nicolosis’ attention to detail, dedication to sourcing quality ingredients, and reverence for the slow, everything-from-scratch process of their old-world brethren has landed them huge points with customers, aficionados, and the media alike. Following appearances on the Travel Channel’s Man vs. Food and Best Sandwich in America, the DiNic’s Roast Pork Sandwich was crowned the Best Sandwich in America in 2013.’",
