Since 2002, Barrio Cafe has been the celebrated home to Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza. Here, her unique cuisine serves to elevate Mexican American culture. Chef Silvana's versions of regional Mexican favorites are recognized as some of the best Mexican cuisine in Phoenix, the region and nationally. Some iconic menu items include Cochinita Pibil, Chiles en Nogada, and Chef's tableside Guacamole. Silvana Salcido Esparza comes from humble beginnings as a baker's daughter in Central Valley, California. She grew up in a multi-generational home, learning to cook with her Grandmother and working alongside her parents in the family bakeries. After culinary school, Chef Silvana traveled independently to all parts of Mexico. She  brought that experience home to Phoenix when, in 2002, she opened  Barrio Cafe with her business partner, Wendy Gruber.' <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

For Chris, the food is a result of his relationships and his intention. Relationships with the farmers, the local producers, his family, customers, and staff; and the respect and sincere intentions he approaches his recipes with, as well as the many interpersonal relationships that have influenced his philosophy and who he is. Chef Nancy Silverton, who founded La Brea Bakery and was a co-founder of Pizzeria Mozza, stated in her book The Mozza Cookbook, “If there was any pizza that I did aspire to, it was a pie made by Chris Bianco, whose Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, AZ is a mecca for the pizza obsessed. When I took a bite of Chris’ pizza, I was speechless. Eating it turned out to be a life-altering experience.”’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
