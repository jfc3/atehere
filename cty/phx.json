				"note": "Barrio Cafe is a bustling eatery serving creative Mexican fare and over 200 tequilas in cozy digs filled with folk art. You should or order the fish in banana leaf, or the Cochinita Pibil which is pork is marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted overnight, topped with pickled red onion and Yucatán-style pico de gallo for a meal or tacos. Don't forget to order the Tilapia wrapped in banana leaves or the smoked goat. From the Phonix Eater website, ‘The Mexican food scene in metro Phoenix can be divided into two eras: before Barrio Cafe’s opening in 2002 — and after. Classically trained chef Silvana Salcido Esparza broke the mold, serving pre-dinner bread instead of the usual chips and salsa while lightly applying French cooking techniques to preparations from all over Mexico — cochinita pibil from the Yucatan, nut-studded chiles en nogada from Puebla, fish from Veracruz, and silky moles from Oaxaca. The work of local Mexican artists fill the restaurant’s interior walls, while the exterior swirls with colorful murals. Agave-based spirits are everywhere these days, but Barrio was the first restaurant in the area to offer a vast selection of them.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",

From their website, 'Our aim is to deliver everything that is exciting and fresh about Mexican cuisine to the people of Arizona, banishing old perceptions of heavy, greasy, taste bud-searing, so-called “Tex-Mex.&rdqou;' From the Phonix Eater website, ‘Maybe it’s because owners Felipe Guzman and Cristina Meillon are from Guadalajara, one of the most metropolitan cities in Mexico, that La Santisima offers such a wide array of regional dishes. The seemingly endless menu options, huge salsa bar, and gigantic servings may be overwhelming at first, but it’s hard to go wrong. Noteworthy tacos include the Andalucia, with potato and chorizo, the Baja Sur dogfish shark taco, or some surprisingly impressive vegan and vegetarian options like La Condesa, with poblano and mushrooms.’ <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
