The James Beard Award America’s Classics winner specializes in Indigenous preparations of stews, tamales, and hand-stretched, plate-sized fry bread served puffy, golden brown, and faintly greasy. Filled with meat, beans, cheese, and various other savory combos, each fry bread is folded like a giant taco. Of course, there’s plenty of sweet fry bread, too — honey with powdered sugar and chocolate with butter, for example — all profoundly satisfying. Its founder, the late Cecelia Miller, used the Tohono O’odham recipes from her youth, including large, hand-stretched tortillas called chumuth, which accompany hearty stews and form the wraps for hefty burros. There may be no restaurant that is more Phoenix than Fry Bread House. A James Beard America’s Classics honoree and staple for more than 30 years, chef Cecelia Miller’s legacy is the most qualified spot to bless your stomach. A hometown hero that still lives up to the hype, Fry Bread House still somehow manages to exceed expectations every time. The fry bread is obviously the star of the show, but you can not go wrong with the posole, green chili beef, or the chocolate and butter sweet fry bread.’",

Relationships with the farmers, the local producers, his family, customers, and staff; and the respect and sincere intentions he approaches his recipes with, as well as the many interpersonal relationships that have influenced his philosophy and who he is. Chef Nancy Silverton, who founded La Brea Bakery and was a co-founder of Pizzeria Mozza, stated in her book The Mozza Cookbook, “If there was any pizza that I did aspire to, it was a pie made by Chris Bianco, whose Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, AZ is a mecca for the pizza obsessed.
