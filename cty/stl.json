At Nudo, you’ll find rich ramen alongside aromatic pho, on a menu that’s been years in the making. You’ll find ramen that one of Japan’s foremost ramen chefs had a hand in crafting. From the Eater St. Loius website, 'Nudo House is the long-awaited ramen restaurant from Qui Tran, whose family founded Mai Lee, St. Louis’s first (and still beloved) Vietnamese restaurant. Tran and co-owner and executive chef Marie-Anne Velasco are serious about ramen — they've even taken lessons from Japanese ramen master Shigetoshi Nakamura — but Nudo House also nods to Tran's Mai Lee background with several variations of pho.'",
