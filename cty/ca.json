Unlike al pastor, however, where the flavors are chile and pineapple-based. Other items worth your while, are cemitas and tacos de cecina. The cemitas are essentially a sandwich version of the taco árabe — a pile of smoking, tender meat on a soft, slightly sweet sesame roll. The cecina, tender and thinly pounded beef, is given a perfect vehicle in two corn tortillas that are stuck together with melted cheese. Ask for some rajitas, tangy strips of pickled pepper, which make a perfect accessory to the tacos.",
