For years, they’ve been planning a second place to present both the foods of their heritage (Menashe grew up in Israel, with Turkish and Moroccan ancestry, and Gergis’s family has Egyptian origins) and the roots they’ve put down in Southern California. In Bavel, they realize their goal. Nubbly duck ’nduja gilds some of the smoothest, most purely earthen hummus in America. Chermoula, preserved orange, smoked anchovy, and herbs wrap grilled dorade in a pleasing surround-sound of flavors. The flatbreads, the roasted lamb neck, the walnut and apricot variation on baklava from Gergis (who is a pastry chef): all sensational. The airy space is totally LA, featuring a suspended garden where vines tumble down from the ceiling. Israel’s melting-pot cuisine has proliferated in Southern California — and across the country — since the couple started planning the restaurant half a decade ago. But Bavel, instantly one of the finest in the genre, has arrived right on time.'",

After all, any restaurant can use high-quality ingredients. The secret to these burgers is cooking the best beef money can buy on the famous Jim-Denny's grill. For over 70 years, the wonderful flavor of the grilled hamburgers has been mellowing and seasoning the grill in the corner window, making it the secret flavor ingredient no other restaurant can duplicate.'",

Ours are the flavors of their lost kitchens: traditions transplanted into Southern California's multicultural soils, alongside local produce and regional meats and seafood, by a chef trained in Michelin-starred kitchens and raised here in Orange County. When Chef Carlos Salgado opened Taco María in 2013, he made a decision to honor his family’s culture and their hard work by making Mexican-inspired food with a reverence for its provenance. Using the best ingredients available and applying the techniques and values he learned in Michelin-starred restaurants, Salgado works to create a syncretic Alta California cuisine that represents Mexican food by putting real corn at the foundation.'",

Housed in what was once a community rec room, it’s equal parts old-school diner and black culture time capsule, a place where the term “soul food” is stretched to its widest connotation. The walls are plastered with posters and playbills commemorating African-American icons — some local, some international — everyone from Otis Redding to Redd Foxx to Malcolm X, along with hundreds of stickers and signs from local businesses and clubs stuck onto every empty surface. Motown tunes float through the air, while retro sitcoms play on a TV in the corner.'",

The restaurant is unassuming in almost every way: Seating is limited to a scattering of industrial-grade patio tables, and the restaurant is tucked into a sleepy mini-mall where there seem to be more tenants than parking spaces. The general mood is one of extreme informality and friendliness. The restaurant’s menu of Oaxacan-inflected, Lebanese-inspired dishes is at its most compelling when it goes full-bore on its vaguely exotic-sounding premise of “Arabesque Oaxacan” cooking.' The Los Angles Times recommends the following dishes: Chicken shawarma taco, tabbouleh Oaxaca salad, Oaxacan hummus, falafel plate, and chorizo kebab.",
