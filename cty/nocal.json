You need to go to one of their stores to order tacos from the Chavez Taqueria. When you walk into this small grocery store, you can smell the tacos/Mexican foods as soon as you walk in the door. I remember ordering the Al Pastor and Lengua and a few other Super Tacos.",

				"note": "The Mi Pueblo Food Center is a supermarket with Latin roots stocking meat, seafood, produce and more, plus a cremería and tortillería. We initially stopped for donuts, and I noticed smoke coming out of the smoker at the other end of the shopping plaza. We walked down, where they were cooking half chickens but noticed in the stop they sold tacos so had to get some of those to hold me over until brunch in Napa.",
