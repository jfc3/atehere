JJ’s Red Hots is not a restaurant. It’s a hot dog joint that serves what we believe are the best hot dogs on the planet. It is a place where service and value still mean something. To us, anyways. In fact, we believe that serving you is a privilege, how do you like that for old school? We also believe strongly in the quality of the products we serve. It matters that we serve Sahlen’s smokehouse hot dogs and sausages – who has been making premium quality products since 1869. It matters that we toast our Martin’s potato rolls, and it matters that we hand-craft pretty much everything else. Our chili, pickles, onion rings, borracho beans, bacon and sausage, and other items are made in-house. We hope you enjoy our hot dogs and sausages as much as we enjoy preparing them and serving them to you.'",
