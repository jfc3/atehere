Brave souls are trying to enjoy spring sunshine despite Lake Erie wind chills in exchange for a taste of summer. These are typical scenes this time of year at Red Top in Hamburg. That’s the way it’s been since 1946 when the original founder returned from the war and opened the hot dog stand. Today, Dennis McNaney and his daughter Lisa run Red Top. They’ve preserved it in its original state since taking ownership in 1980. No one really knows why it’s called Red Top, but one thing is certain – it’s a Western New York pastime that customers still embrace.’ Titus tweeted, ‘Red Top Hot Dogs (Hamburg, NY). Live charcoal-grilled Wardynski’s natural casing wiener (pork/beef). Variety of toppings offered. I did mustard, onion, chopped dill pickles. Plus, an order of cottage fries. Overlooking Lake Erie. Since 1949.’",
