				"note": "Duff's Famous Wings is an established restaurant known for its chicken wings and drumsticks coated in spicy house sauce. If you ask locals about chicken wings, they will recommend Duffs. When my family gets together, we order 50 or 100 wings extra crispy with sauce on the side and a few order of fries and gravy. With my parents living three miles away we found it's best to mix the sauce in once we get them home to keep the wings crispy on the outside. <strong>NOTE</strong>: They have multiple locations.",
