 I’ll plug my former employer invisionapp.com which is a design collaboration platform. Can sync designs from Sketch and Photoshop, get stakeholder feedback, etc. There is a developer handoff tool call Inspect for getting css values, etc and a whiteboard tool call Freehand.

I have a standing desk and chair from https://www.autonomous.ai/
